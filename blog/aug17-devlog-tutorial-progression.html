                    <p>This week was spent chipping away at tutorial progression and finishing pattern animation sheets and masking sheets for the walking animations.</p>

                    <p>Now every guinea pig can be fully customized and be able to walk around the cage without 404 errors/patterns not displaying. You can probably notice that the sprites 'blink' a bit as they move around - I'm working on fixing this. This same problem happened when I was adding patterns without the RGB masks, and it was easily fixed.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's three or four sections of the tutorial, and as I complete it, the more of the game gets finished. The first part of the tutorial, which I've been calling the "Lia" part of the tutorial (the name of the shopkeeper), has been finished for a while now - the second part ("post-Lia") is now finished, which shows how to place and interact with items in the cage. The last addition in order to finish this section of the tutorial was to make it possible to fill, clean, and stow away water bottles, hay racks, and food bowls.</p>

                    <p>Admittedly, I could have done a lot more this week, but I've also been building my personal portfolio and applying/interviewing for jobs this week (as well as a LOT of housework), so productivity was slightly lower. I really want to publish this game soon, and I've stopped putting time into making TikToks for the time being so that any free time I have is given towards the development of this game. I'm still on track to publishing at least a first version of this game in winter.</p>
